# Project TODO

0.5.0 main features:
- [ ] About dialog in the top menu
- [ ] Auto-create models from unsorted G-code and model files (Import button)
- [x] Eject SD card option when storage lives on an SD drive
- [ ] G-code preview button in the 3D preview dialog (3D view)
- [ ] Menu bar (Windows text-only style)
- [ ] Settings page to change storage location and move files
- [ ] Support alternate STL/3MF files


0.4.0 main features:
more file management improvments
- [x] can select models to be "active" which places a copy of the gcode in the root directory of the storage location
- [x] remove microsd/local mode, microsd use can just be selecting a different drive, add a "drive not found" alert if microsd is not inserted

## Backlog

## Completed
- [x] Ignore the test config.json from packaging
- [x] Import and implement new icons (0.40)
- [x] update program to reflect v0.030
- [x] v0.30 beta release notes
- [x] PROBLEM: top bars text size reverses to small font after theme toggle
- [x] add button in the edit dialogue to set preview image as regenerate model preview image
- [x] make the app show a loading bar instead of not responding when loading large file
- [x] save mode (microsd/local) in config json so it is used as the default in save location dropdown in the add model menu
- [x] save the theme every time it is switched
- [x] make sure "system volume information" doesnt show as a model
- [x] remove "system volume information" as it is not a model
- [x] add loading bars for everything so the window will not be "not responding"
- [x] limit to 3 columns at max window size
- [x] Build metadata edit dialog and persistence
- [x] Make 3D model preview & interactive viewer work with 3MF files
- [x] Add 3D preview display using popup window for selected model (3d view button)
- [x] Load models from configuration and hydrate gallery cards
- [x] Enable search, sorting, and material filtering controls
- [x] Implement import workflow for new models (dialog + packaging)
- [x] Generate STL thumbnails with adaptive cropping and caching
- [x] Add loading overlay sourced from UI file for async refreshes
- [x] Apply theme toggle with tinted icons and persisted preference
- [x] Modernize scrollbars in light and dark themes
- [x] Implement "Add Model" button to show popup
- [x] Make "Import" button select or create a models folder and persist configuration
- [x] Package Windows release (PyInstaller bundle + Inno Setup installer)

## Release Notes
### 0.4.0 (2025-11-04)

- Consolidated storage configuration around a single `storage_path`, migrating legacy settings and prompting when removable drives are missing.
- Added an Active/Inactive toggle on each model card that copies the selected G-code into the storage root and keeps metadata in sync.
- Introduced removable-drive detection with a toolbar "Eject SD" control that safely dismounts cards directly from zPrint.
- Refined gallery styling with consistent card sizing, clearer delete/activate affordances, and aligned top-bar buttons.
- Simplified the welcome, import, and add-model flows to reuse the chosen storage location while ensuring folders are created when needed.
- Hardened configuration persistence and prompts so storage updates, drive changes, and theme selections are saved immediately.

### 0.30 beta (2025-11-04)

- Tuned the VisPy-powered 3D viewer for smooth orbit, pan, and zoom across large STL and 3MF models, including graceful fallbacks when meshes fail to process.
- Expanded the Edit Model dialog with a Regenerate Preview button, richer metadata validation, and one-click G-code management (add, remove, copy, delete).
- Added a first-launch welcome prompt to guide storage location selection and default theme setup.
- Added determinate progress overlays around gallery refreshes and preview generation so the window stays responsive during heavy work.
- Persisted theme selection and default storage mode immediately and enlarged the default main window to 1280×900 for better first-run ergonomics.
- Hardened 3MF preview generation and packaging by bundling SciPy, networkx, and lxml along with the VisPy runtime, ensuring the standalone build and installer ship all viewer dependencies.

### 0.20 beta (2025-11-03)
- Added 3MF support across gallery thumbnails and interactive viewer.
- Upgraded STL viewer dialog to VisPy for responsive, GPU-accelerated interaction.
- Config saved under `%APPDATA%\zPrint` with document-root fallback.
- Import flow supports creating new model folders and updates gallery empty state.
- Added Windows build pipeline: PyInstaller spec, release script, and Inno Setup installer.
- Embedded official logo into executable, installer, and shortcuts.

### 0.10 beta (initial drop)
- Initial gallery experience with search, sort, and material filters.
- Theme toggle, loading overlay, and STL thumbnail rendering pipeline.
- Added New Model dialog scaffold and JSON-backed gallery hydration.
