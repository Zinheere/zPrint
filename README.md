## Building

### Windows executable and installer

1. Install build dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (PyInstaller is included).
2. (Optional) Install [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) if you want an installer; ensure `ISCC.exe` is on your `PATH` or installed in the default location.
3. Run the release script from PowerShell: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build_windows_release.ps1`.

The script produces two outputs inside `dist/`:

- `dist/zPrint/` contains the portable PyInstaller bundle.
- `dist/installer/zPrint-Setup.exe` is the Inno Setup installer (skipped when `-SkipInstaller` is passed).

Use `scripts/build_windows_release.ps1 -SkipInstaller` if you only need the standalone folder without an installer.
